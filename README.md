# **Review-Sentiment-Analyzer**  

This project analyzes the sentiment of movie reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It was developed as part of a learning experience for a university course, with the aim of understanding text classification and machine learning concepts.  

On my end, the model achieved **85.62% accuracy**, though results may vary based on the dataset and training parameters used.
